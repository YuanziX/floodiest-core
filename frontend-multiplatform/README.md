# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

Maybe the real expo apps were the friends we made along the way.

## Get started

1. Install a bad programming language

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app using the worst package manager

   ```bash
    npx expo start

- [For sideloading lucky patcher](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [Simulating bad taste](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [the international lottery](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
